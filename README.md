# SpeakerDomeCalibration
An all-in-one calibration patch for speaker domes.

# tldr: work-in-progress
This is a very messy patch at the moment, mainly scraping together the core things to get a system that works and is useful. Once I nailed down everything I want to involve I'll make it pretty!

# The HISS got me
Huge thanks to the HISS Tools Package for Max, made by Alex Harker and Pierre-Alexandre Tremblay. This patch is basically a (soon-to-be) beautified and extended/generalized version of the speaker calibration tutorial patch that comes with the package.

Extra thanks for Alex for tolerating my silly questions and always being available to help!
